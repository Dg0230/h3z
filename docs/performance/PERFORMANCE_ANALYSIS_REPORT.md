## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. Critical: Route Cache Hash Collision (üö®)
**Problem**: Route cache implementation had memory management issues causing hash collisions and panics.
- **Symptoms**: `reached unreachable code` panic in hash map operations
- **Root Cause**: Improper string memory management in cache keys
- **Impact**: Application crashes under load

### 2. High: Performance Degradation Under Load (‚ö†Ô∏è)
**Problem**: Response time increased by 21.3% from first 1000 to last 1000 requests.
- **Symptoms**: Progressive slowdown from 374Œºs to 454Œºs average response time
- **Root Cause**: Memory leaks in event pool and inefficient object reset
- **Impact**: Degraded user experience under sustained load

### 3. Medium: Event Pool Memory Leaks (‚ö°)
**Problem**: Event objects not properly reset, causing memory accumulation.
- **Symptoms**: Decreasing pool efficiency with larger pool sizes
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete cleanup in event reset logic
- **Impact**: Memory pressure and reduced performance

### 4. Medium: Middleware Execution Overhead (‚ö°)
**Problem**: Each middleware call had unnecessary overhead.
- **Symptoms**: High per-request processing time
- **Root Cause**: Inefficient middleware chain execution
- **Impact**: Reduced throughput

## üîß Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Route Cache Implementation
**File**: `src/core/route_cache_fixed.zig`

**Key Improvements**:
- Proper memory management for cache keys with owned strings
- Fixed hash collision handling with correct cleanup
- Implemented LRU eviction with proper node management
- Added comprehensive error handling and memory tracking

```zig
// Before: Unsafe string references
const CacheKey = struct {
    path: []const u8, // Dangling pointer risk
};

// After: Owned memory management
const CacheKey = struct {
    path: []u8, // Owned memory
    allocator: std.mem.Allocator,

    pub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, path: []const u8) !CacheKey {
        const owned_path = try allocator.dupe(u8, path);
        return CacheKey{ .path = owned_path, .allocator = allocator };
    }
};
```

### 2. Optimized Event Pool
**File**: `src/core/event_pool_fixed.zig`

**Key Improvements**:
- Arena allocator for temporary operations during reset
- Improved event reset logic with proper memory cleanup
- Smart string management to avoid freeing static strings
- Periodic maintenance and pool optimization

```zig
// Efficient reset with arena allocator
fn resetEvent(self: *EventPool, event: *H3Event) !void {
    _ = self.arena.reset(.retain_capacity);

    // Clear maps retaining capacity for performance
    event.context.clearRetainingCapacity();
    event.params.clearRetainingCapacity();

    // Smart cleanup - only free non-static strings
    if (!isStaticPath(event.request.path)) {
        self.allocator.free(event.request.path);
    }
}
```

### 3. Optimized Memory Manager
**File**: `src/core/memory_manager_optimized.zig`

**Key Improvements**:
- Arena allocators for request-scoped and temporary memory
- Automatic garbage collection based on memory pressure
- Memory usage tracking and health monitoring
- Configurable allocation strategies

```zig
pub const MemoryManager = struct {
    request_arena: std.heap.ArenaAllocator,
    temp_arena: std.heap.ArenaAllocator,
    event_pool: ?EventPool,

    pub fn resetRequestArena(self: *MemoryManager) void {
        _ = self.request_arena.reset(.retain_capacity);
        if (self.stats.current_usage > self.config.gc_threshold) {
            self.performGC();
        }
    }
};
```

### 4. Fast Middleware Optimization
**File**: `src/core/fast_middleware_optimized.zig`

**Key Improvements**:
- Pre-compiled execution paths for common middleware combinations
- Inlined common operations to reduce function call overhead
- Stack-based formatting to avoid allocations
- Optimized middleware chain execution

```zig
// Fast path for common patterns
fn executeCommonPattern(self: *const FastMiddlewareChain, event: *H3Event) !void {
    // Inline logger to avoid function call
    if (self.has_logger) {
        var buffer: [256]u8 = undefined;
        const log_msg = std.fmt.bufPrint(buffer[0..], "{s} {s}",
            .{ event.getMethod().toString(), event.getPath() }) catch "LOG_ERROR";
        std.log.info("{s}", .{log_msg});
    }

    // Inline CORS headers
    if (self.has_cors) {
        try event.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        // ... other headers
    }
}
```
