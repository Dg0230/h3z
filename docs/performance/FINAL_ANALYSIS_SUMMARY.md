# H3 Framework – Performance Issue Analysis & Solution Summary

## 🎯 Diagnostic Findings

### Primary Issue: Memory Leak Causes Gradual Slow-Down

**Root Cause**: The `resetEvent` method in the event pool used `clearRetainingCapacity()` without properly freeing the key/value memory previously allocated inside the `HashMap`.

**Impact**:
- After each request the `context`, `params`, and `query` data inside the event object were **not** cleared correctly.
- Memory usage grew continuously as the number of requests increased.
- Higher GC pressure resulted in progressively slower response times.

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. Event Pool Memory-Leak Fix
**Location**: `src/core/optimized/event_pool.zig:77-102`

**Before**:
```zig
// Only clears containers, does **not** free memory
event.context.clearRetainingCapacity();
event.params.clearRetainingCapacity();
event.query.clearRetainingCapacity();
```

**After**:
```zig
// Correctly free all allocated memory
var context_iter = event.context.iterator();
while (context_iter.next()) |entry| {
    self.allocator.free(entry.key_ptr.*);
    self.allocator.free(entry.value_ptr.*);
}
event.context.clearRetainingCapacity();
// Same treatment for params and query
```
