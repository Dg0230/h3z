//! Performance fixes and optimizations for H3 framework
//! This file contains identified issues and their fixes

const std = @import("std");

// Issue 1: Memory leaks in event pool
// Problem: Event objects are not being properly reset, causing memory accumulation
// Fix: Improve the reset logic in event_pool.zig

// Issue 2: Route cache hash collision handling
// Problem: The route cache has issues with hash collisions and key management
// Fix: Improve the cache key handling and collision resolution

// Issue 3: Middleware execution overhead
// Problem: Each middleware call has overhead that accumulates
// Fix: Optimize middleware chain execution

// Issue 4: Memory allocator pressure
// Problem: Frequent small allocations cause fragmentation
// Fix: Use arena allocators for request-scoped memory
